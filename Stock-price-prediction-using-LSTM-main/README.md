# About
#### Collected and processed over 5 years of daily stock data (~6,300 records per company) using the Yahoo Finance API and performed data cleaning and feature engineering for time-series analysis.
#### Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and conducted back testing to validate the model's predictive capabilities.
