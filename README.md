<h2>About Me</h2>
Hello! Welcome to my online portfolio. My name is Kwabena Danso Ntim. I am a self-taught 
programmer with a background in engineering and project management. My journey into the 
world of coding began with self-learning from free online resources. Initially, my expertise 
revolved around Microsoft Excel, where I gained mastery over MS Office applications.

Excel VBA and SPSS Proficiency
One of my significant early coding projects was the development of a "Dewatering Sheet" 
using Excel VBA for my boss during my National Service. This project marked my entry into 
mainstream coding and provided me with valuable hands-on experience. Additionally, I am 
proficient in SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), which I have utilized for 
various projects, including assisting MSc students with their research endeavours. My 
expertise in SPSS allows me to analyze and interpret data effectively, contributing to 
insightful research outcomes.

Transition to Python and Data Science
Following the completion of the "Dewatering Sheet" project, I realized the vast potential in 
coding and decided to delve deeper. My exploration led me to Python, where I ventured into 
the field of data science. Leveraging libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, I 
analyzed data for TonyCee Mining Services, a mining contractor undertaking a reclamation 
project in Goldfields Ghana Limited, Damang. From the data gathered, I was able to 
streamline operations and cut operational costs by 27%.

Machine Learning Projects
Driven by a passion for learning and innovation, I further expanded my skills into machine 
learning. I have undertaken several machine learning projects, leveraging libraries such as 
scikit-learn, Streamlit and TensorFlow. These projects showcase my ability to apply machine 
learning algorithms to real-world problems and drive business outcomes.

Engineering and Project Management Background
My background in engineering and project management has significantly influenced my 
approach to coding. These skills have equipped me with a structured mindset, attention to 
detail, and the ability to effectively manage complex projects. In addition to my programming 
skills, I am proficient in geological software applications, including Datamine, Surpac, and 
Leapfrog, among others. My familiarity with these tools enables me to integrate geological 
insights into data-driven projects seamlessly.

Future Endeavours: TensorFlow Certification
Currently, I am actively working towards obtaining my TensorFlow certification, which will 
further solidify my expertise in machine learning and deep learning technologies.
