<h2>About Me</h2>
Hello! Welcome to my online portfolio. My name is Kwabena Danso Ntim. I am a self-taught 
programmer with a background in engineering and project management. My journey into the 
world of coding began with self-learning from free online resources. Initially, my expertise 
revolved around Microsoft Excel, where I gained mastery over MS Office applications.

<h2>Excel VBA and SPSS Proficiency</h2>
One of my significant early coding projects was the development of a "Dewatering Sheet" 
using Excel VBA for my boss during one of my internships. This project marked my entry into 
mainstream coding and provided me with valuable hands-on experience. Additionally, I am 
proficient in SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), which I have utilized for 
various projects, including assisting MSc students with their research endeavours. My 
expertise in SPSS allows me to analyze and interpret data effectively, contributing to 
insightful research outcomes.

<h2>Transition to Python and Data Science</h2>
Following the completion of the "Dewatering Sheet" project, I realized the vast potential in 
coding and decided to delve deeper. My exploration led me to Python, where I ventured into 
the field of data science. Leveraging libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, I 
analyzed data for TonyCee Mining Services, a mining contractor undertaking a reclamation 
project in Goldfields Ghana Limited, Damang. From the data gathered, I was able to 
streamline operations and cut operational costs by 27%.

<h2?Machine Learning Projects</h2>
Driven by a passion for learning and innovation, I further expanded my skills into machine 
learning. I have undertaken several machine learning projects, leveraging libraries such as 
scikit-learn, Streamlit and TensorFlow. These projects showcase my ability to apply machine 
learning algorithms to real-world problems and drive business outcomes.

<h2>Engineering and Project Management Background</h2>
My background in engineering and project management has significantly influenced my 
approach to coding. These skills have equipped me with a structured mindset, attention to 
detail, and the ability to effectively manage complex projects. In addition to my programming 
skills, I am proficient in geological software applications, including Datamine, Surpac, and 
Leapfrog, among others. My familiarity with these tools enables me to integrate geological 
insights into data-driven projects seamlessly.

<h2>Future Endeavours: TensorFlow Certification</h2>
Currently, I am actively working towards obtaining my TensorFlow certification, which will 
further solidify my expertise in machine learning and deep learning technologies.
