## üåç Introduction
Earthquake prediction is a critical area of research aiming to mitigate the impact of seismic activities on society and infrastructure. This project utilizes machine learning techniques, particularly LSTM neural networks, to forecast the magnitude of earthquakes based on historical seismic data.

## üíª Installation
To install and run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the main script `earthquake_prediction.py` to train the LSTM model and make predictions.

## üöÄ Usage
After installing the necessary dependencies and running the main script, you can use the trained LSTM model to make earthquake magnitude predictions. Additionally, you can customize the model architecture and hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project comprises historical earthquake records, encompassing attributes such as timestamp, geographic coordinates, depth, and magnitude. Prior to employment, the data undergoes preprocessing and partitioning into training and testing subsets for model training and assessment.

### Kandilli Observatory Live Earthquake Data
Live earthquake data from the Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute can be accessed through the following API endpoint:
```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.orhanaydogdu.com.tr/deprem/kandilli/live' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```

  ### Sample Response:

| Date & Time (UTC)   | Location_tz        | Depth (km) | Magnitude |
|---------------------|--------------------|------------|-----------|
| 2024-03-19 21:36:40 | Europe/Istanbul    | 7          | 2.8       |
| 2024-03-19 21:14:44 | Europe/Istanbul    | 6.8        | 1.9       |
| 2024-03-19 19:48:26 | Europe/Istanbul    | 12.5       | 1.7       |
| 2024-03-19 19:43:28 | Europe/Istanbul    | 10.2       | 2.9       |
| 2024-03-19 19:40:16 | Europe/Istanbul    | 5          | 2.4       |


+ This API endpoint provides access to live earthquake data for real-time monitoring and analysis purposes.


## üß† Model Architecture
The LSTM neural network architecture used in this project consists of multiple LSTM layers followed by dense layers for regression. The model takes sequential earthquake data as input and learns to predict the magnitude of future earthquakes.
## üìâ Results

The performance of the LSTM model is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

Additionally, the correlation coefficient between predicted and actual earthquake magnitudes is calculated to assess the model's performance.
